## üîß What It Does

Warez Rescue allows you to quickly and efficiently **recover media files** from a given path, writing them to an output directory, with optional verbose logging.

## üêç Python Usage

Import and use the recovery function via the namespace:

```python
from pypol.media_rescue import *

# Usage
recover(imgpath, outpath, verbose=args.verbose)
```

imgpath: path to the source image or media storage

outpath: output directory where recovered files will be saved

verbose: enable verbose logging (True/False)

This script is minimal, focused, and ready to plug into your media workflows.
